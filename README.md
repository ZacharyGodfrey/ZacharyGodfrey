# Hi, I'm Zach.

I'm a senior software engineer based in Florida and I've been building software since 2013. My current tech stack consists of Typescript and Postgres on AWS, but I've also got a history of working in the .NET world with C# and SQL Server.

## My Current Side Project

I'm calling the project [microlith](https://github.com/ZacharyGodfrey/microlith) (micro + monolith). It’s a small, intentionally monolithic web application using Node, Express, and Postgres.

The microservice architecture is hot right now because it works well for massive, successful products like Netflix. Who doesn’t want to be a huge success, right? But realistically, most production websites won’t require that kind of scale even if they’re successful. Still, it seems that everyone is breaking their monoliths into separate microservices anyway.

I'm building this project to test the hypothesis that a monolithic app would actually offer some benefits over microservices for these apps that don't require massive scale.

Monolithic apps, when done well, can maintain a simplicity that leads to faster onboarding of new team members, faster implementation of new features, a simpler process for local development, and an easier time tracking down the source of bugs.

The point is to delay adding the complexity of microservices to keep things simple so that developers can move quickly in response to the rapid requirement changes that happen when a project is iterating on user feedback.
