# Hi, I'm Zach.

I'm a senior software engineer based in Florida and I've been building software since 2013. My current tech stack consists of Typescript and Postgres on AWS, but I've also got a history of working in the .NET world with C# and SQL Server.

You can check out my [website](https://zacharygodfrey.dev) for more details.

## My Current Side Project

I'm calling the project [microlith](https://github.com/ZacharyGodfrey/microlith) (micro + monolith). Itâ€™s a small, intentionally monolithic web application using Node, Express, and Postgres. This is just a proof of concept project to see how simple I can keep things while building a web app from scratch.
