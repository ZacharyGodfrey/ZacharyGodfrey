# Hi, I'm Zach.

I'm a senior software engineer based in Florida and I've been building software since 2013. My current tech stack consists of Angular and Node with Typescript, Postgres, and Elasticsearch on AWS, but I've also got a history of working in the .NET world with C# and SQL Server.

## My Current Side Project

I'm building an HTTP API for an online store as a proof of concept using Node, Express, and Postgres. I want to see how simple I can keep things while building an API from scratch. You can check out the [shop-api](https://github.com/ZacharyGodfrey/shop-api) repo to see how it's going.
